          <p>I'm a full-stack developer with a background in federal government and international education. I strive to deliver products that are intuitive, accessible, and well designed.</p>
          <p> I'm a Hoosier who has lived in Chile, Turkey, Azerbaijan, and D.C., and I now proudly call Philadelphia my home. When I'm not coding, you can find me spending time outside running, biking, or reading in a hammock. </p>
